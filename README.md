# Mitigating Attacks on Artificial Intelligence-based Spectrum Sensing for Cellular Network Signals

This research paper concerns how well different wireless networks work and how they can be improved. The main goal of wireless networks is to connect many other devices with high-speed data transmission. Researchers are looking at new approaches to using artificial intelligence for spectrum management in cellular networks to improve the networks. This paper analyses one method for identifying cellular network signals under adversarial attacks. The results showed that the method could be improved to reduce the vulnerabilities of the AI-based spectrum sensing models against adversarial attacks.
